2025-09-18 17:40:54-07:00,3,ùïìùï£ùïíùïüùïïùïö,Very glitchy,Slow and glitchy. Frustrated to use
2025-09-08 08:04:35-07:00,1,Mattysclerosis,Scam,Said of you paid for the pro version you get 12 free image to video per day and any addition cost 6 credits.  I paid the $80 and received none of those things. I got 40 credits and the image to video charged 30. So basically I laid $80 for one pic
2025-09-08 07:04:12-07:00,1,BREasy518,Took payment before trial was over,I downloaded and looked at the app said a 7dat trial. Did not use. 79.99 was immediately removed from my account and I have yet to receive a refund.
2025-09-07 04:30:12-07:00,1,Uffdaboy,Was great when it worked,"This was a fantastic app, so much so AI purchased the VIP plan for a year and know most of the features have suddenly stopped working"
2025-09-06 14:52:35-07:00,1,NashandTobey26,Awful!!!!!,They are thieves! The app is slow and doesn‚Äôt work. They trick you into buying things. Do NOT recommend
2025-09-04 18:09:24-07:00,1,eglantinelucy,SCAM ALERT!,Canceled the same day I signed up for free trial and was still charged! Apple denied my refund!
2025-09-04 16:10:00-07:00,1,asdffgghhjjkkjfzc,Bad quality overall,This AI app is not good quality and really makes you look like a clown. Don‚Äôt waste your time just choose another app to use.
2025-09-03 06:45:58-07:00,1,25Unhappy,Dishonest,I signed up for a 7 day free trial of the app to see if it would do what I needed.  I have been charged $80 for an app that does not do what I needed and that was supposed to be a free trial.  I have given 1 star because there is not an option for 0 stars.
2025-09-02 18:38:29-07:00,2,Asdfjklsdfbvcsew,Latest update,Kind of upset that I have the upgraded version of this app that I paid for and now on the latest update no longer lets you use it for ‚Äúwhitening teeth‚Äù sends you to the makeup app and you have to pay again to get a second upgrade in order to use teeth whitening function .
2025-08-31 22:21:19-07:00,1,Ebsnyy,Scam,They make it so hard to find the ‚Äúdelete my account‚Äù section the ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù is false information and I don‚Äôt trust this app AT ALL . I think they are a scam
2025-08-31 09:48:01-07:00,1,Dragon223,No way to cancel 24 hour trial,20 hours ago I signed up for a 24 hour trial of YouCam Perfect Pro. I found the AI object remover was not able to handle the task I needed done. Now I find I can find no way to cancel and get my $79.99 back. It‚Äôs clearly a powerful tool but not one I need to
2025-08-29 13:50:49-07:00,1,KristinaHikes,Fraudulent Charges,Canceled subscription and they refuse to refund me. 0 support from app.
2025-08-22 12:32:45-07:00,1,Toplum Polisi,Free trial is a scam do not install the app,FREE TRIAL IS A SCAM DO NOT INSTALL THE APP UNLESS YOU HAVE A LOT MONEY TO TRASH
2025-08-21 21:30:27-07:00,5,karmabesos,Perfect for people that just want to soften without looking fake!,As an ex model I love this app as you can pre set the amount you want to beautify as you take the photo. I don‚Äôt want a totally photoshopped image I like to keep as natural as possible but love the way I can just tweak it slightly to blur out the shine or shadows. To be honest I don‚Äôt use all the features but if you are after a little soft focus without the fake look this is the app for you!
2025-08-15 09:05:04-07:00,1,Cxr99,Free trial is a scam!,I downloaded the app because of the free trial. I had just came back from vacation and remembered to cancel trial however that morning I noticed I had already been charged $80!  I never intended to purchase this subscription & Apple won‚Äôt even give me a refund! This is ridiculous!!
2025-08-13 18:36:47-07:00,1,Hate this app!$!,Free trial is a scam!!!,Cancelled on 7th day but still got charged $85!!! Not worth the features by a long shot
2025-08-12 16:24:10-07:00,1,ikkhgujjhj,horrible app,"this app is absolutely horrible doesn‚Äôt work and it just not necessary it gives fake and ugly not natural

2025-08-10 09:22:09-07:00,1,DaeguDave,BEWARE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!,"I guess I downloaded this program all though I don‚Äôt remember using it ever. 
Yesterday I was charged $79.99 for a year renewal. 
I received no notice that they would be charging me for b this or I would have cancelled it way before. 
I went through Apple to get a refund one day after I was charged and they refuse to refund. 
BEWARE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!"

2025-08-05 12:21:48-07:00,5,Horrible messenger,This is Awesome!,This is the best app for perfecting already taken photographs to taking new selfies! I just started fooling around with it but it‚Äôs really cool.
2025-08-03 09:36:27-07:00,1,LonnyBreaux,App use to be good,The app use to be good now they‚Äôre just money hungry making me upgrade when I already pay a monthly membership. Scammers
2025-08-02 20:48:28-07:00,5,bibi05$,It became a free app that you have to pay for everything,Now for any photo change it is paid!
2025-08-01 14:01:02-07:00,1,Summerbussey,Took away my LIFETIME membership,Don‚Äôt buy anything on this app. They will take it away at anytime. Paid over $106 for a lifetime membership a little over a year ago and suddenly I do not have access to my lifetime membership for pro features. It is now telling me that I need to buy coins and I have a limit of three free uses of tools a day. Why would I have paid over $100 for only a year of use? Totally ripped me off. Hoping to get a refund. But we will see about this since this was over a year ago I purchased and trusted it would be lifetime. If I don‚Äôt receive a refund or membership restore (which I do not see lifetime as an option to purchase anymore)  they definitely lost someone who actually liked this app enough to purchase the lifetime membership. I will not be recommending this to anyone anymore otherwise. Will update this review
2025-07-31 18:11:25-07:00,1,Myles keys,Worst game,This game is a big waste of time don‚Äôt download this stupid cringe game.   This is so stupid.  Make a better game.
2025-07-30 18:05:22-07:00,1,IE@cookies,This app is horrible,You need a subscription for everything
2025-07-30 17:45:35-07:00,5,Natopoly,Love this app!,This app is amazing. Definitely recommend it!
2025-07-29 21:42:36-07:00,2,Shayshi328,Great app until the subscription price increase.,"Will not be using anymore. I had the 10$ monthly subscription for 6 months. It worked perfect for me. It wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúpro‚Äù plan, but I was able to use most of the editing tools. Until one day they increased the price by like 50% without warning. Which didn‚Äôt charge me, however all of the editing tools I had been using in my current subscription the last 6 months I suddenly weren‚Äôt able to use anymore. And now were part of the ‚Äúpro‚Äù plan. If I would have known that I wouldn‚Äôt have paid for that months subscription. Because the specific AI editing tools that the ‚Äúpro‚Äù plan only offers now, I had been using for months, for half the price."
2025-07-28 20:09:10-07:00,1,Jaysi816,Trial scam,"This app is set up to where it shows like you‚Äôre getting a free trial, but if you don‚Äôt click a small option you‚Äôre actually bypassing the trial and paying for it immediately."
2025-07-23 22:12:14-07:00,5,OneMedspa Amy,The best,The best out of all the photoshop app. Includes tons of styles and options
2025-07-23 20:22:25-07:00,1,Princesa_Baca,Scam app,"Gives you the option of a ‚Äúfree‚Äù 7 day trial before starting a subscription, when I agreed to the 7 day trial, I was immediately charged without consent for a full year subscription up front at the cost of 79.99 plus tax! I immediately cancelled it and sent Apple a refund request and deleted this deceptive app!! Would NOT recommend"
2025-07-22 20:15:43-07:00,1,Hm8883828,Charged me wrongly,I wanted to try the trial version after that monthly but then they charged for the whole year I never use for whole year which was $85.29. And the apply rejected for a refund.
2025-07-18 15:53:34-07:00,1,Erika2591,Free trial is a scam,Don‚Äôt do the free trial. I was on vacation when I activated it and forgot to cancel immediately. I went to cancel the 7 day free trial on what should have been the last day of it and they had already charged my card $84. I am livid. This was a purchase I never intended to make and Apple said it is not eligible for a refund. This app is not even worth as much as they are charging. I can‚Äôt even type all of the words I have to express how angry I am over this because they probably won‚Äôt publish my review.
2025-07-17 18:51:02-07:00,1,Anna Nalepka,They charged me one day earlier than the renewal date!,I started a seven day free trial on this app on 7/11/2025 it was due to be charged my credit card on 7/18/2025 today is7/17//2025 and as I picked up my phone to cancel the subscription so I WOULD NOT be charged I get a notification that my card was charged anyway! On 7/17/2025 !! they charged me on the 6th day!!! Want a FULL REFUND  of $79.99 ISSUED TO MY CARD IMMEDIATELY!!!
2025-07-16 13:22:29-07:00,1,WatSi323,They stole my money after a free trial,"Don‚Äôt try their free trial. There‚Äôs not much to do in this app and if you forget to cancel before the end of the trial, they will charge a whole year. This app is useless almost $80 for something that didn‚Äôt work. Now they keep saying that they can‚Äôt cancel this or refund my money even though I don‚Äôt use it."

2025-07-07 08:29:35-07:00,1,yall a scam,downgraded every year,Ive had this app since i was young. It used to have options for free and now they are all under a pay wall they also made it so you cant screenshot uour picture in app without paying. Its basically unusable unless you pay 80 bucks which is crazy for an app that basically does nothing compared to better photo editing software
2025-07-07 07:53:32-07:00,1,Lsncbdvhdvahd dbcn,Diz que √© de gra√ßa mas bloqueia qualquer print de tela,Tentei dar print e o app bloqueia a foto. N√£o d√° pra saber se o app √© bom ou n√£o! N√£o recomendo
2025-07-06 07:52:43-07:00,5,RegP,Great App,This app is great! Use this ISS great app if your cell phone camera malfunctions. Improve photos in 2 minutes for free!
2025-07-03 14:09:08-07:00,1,Jones454,Scammed and out of money,"Don‚Äôt do it ! The free trial is scam , and Apple will not give you a refund. It says a free trial but they charge you immediately and now Im out of 80$."
2025-07-02 05:45:33-07:00,2,Dc946,Not what I needed,"While the app had lots of options, it wasn‚Äôt quite what I needed and not as user friendly. I tried to cancel the trial but was still charged. Apple support has been unable to help and I can‚Äôt contact the developer. I now have an expensive app that doesn‚Äôt fit my needs."
2025-06-30 22:19:12-07:00,1,Lovebug1195,Scam,"They offer you a free trial & when you accept or purchase it, it charges you the $74.99 price and then you‚Äôll see at the very bottom after you purchase it ever so tiny a button to turn ON the free trial to accept it. But then you‚Äôve already paid. I‚Äôd love a refund if you guys have any morals. Horrible."
2025-06-30 16:20:00-07:00,1,uptownpower,SCAM!,"Was charged the monthly membership price of $13 IMMEDIATELY, although it clearly STATED I was given a 7-day free trial and a date of 7/7/25 as beginning of membership and only if I decided so! 
MISINFORMATION = SCAM
Issue the refund NOW or I‚Äôll take it to my finance lawyer."
2025-06-27 10:35:50-07:00,1,AngelR1015,Purposely Lowers Quality,"The photos on my phone are clear but once I upload them to this app it purposely lowers the quality so you have to buy their subscription to get a higher quality photo. Total deception. Do not waste your money on this app, that‚Äôs what they want is your money so be careful because they‚Äôll purposely make your photo low quality when you upload it so you pay to make it look ‚Äúbetter‚Äù."
2025-06-27 09:00:16-07:00,1,mcullough1997,Maliciously charged me for pro and won‚Äôt give refund,Terrible product. Horrible editing and severely affects image quality

2025-06-18 22:34:41-07:00,1,Leo Forever,Deceived. I signed up for the FREE version but got charged the full amount a few hours later.  Fraud,"On June 16, 2025, I signed up for the FREE/ trial version BUT to my surprise and dismay, only a few hours later I was  billed for an annual subscription - $79.99 - ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. I signed up for the FREE / Trial version. They are supposed to automatically charge your credit card if you don‚Äôt cancel the  annual subscription before the end of the trial. I didn‚Äôt even have time to see if I like the app. I was billed hours after my trial started. That‚Äôs fraud. They stole from me. This charge was not authorized. You can see both the Free and the yearly plan were done on the same day. I‚Äôm not sure why Apple declined this, but I read on the forum that this has happened time and time again with apps. I don‚Äôt know if Apple is in cahoots with some of these app developers, but please be careful. It‚Äôs extra work but you‚Äôll  have to go to your credit card company and dispute it there but Apple should be taken care of these. This is crazy.. Who can you trust? The options are getting smaller"
2025-06-17 14:38:13-07:00,1,DawgPatch Shiner,Scammers,The app developers are thieves. I subscribed for a free 1 week trial and instead they charged me 79.99 for an annual subscription the same day I subscribed for the free trial.  I requested a refund since I did not subscribe for an annual subscription and they denied it. Do not subscribe for a free trial because they steal your money.

2025-06-08 18:29:59-07:00,1,LKRC35,Scam,This is a complete scam. Now they limit the number of times you can use certain features even when you pay for a subscription!! Absolutely ridiculous. I want my money back.

2025-05-31 10:26:32-07:00,1,aravioliii,Deceptive layout‚Äî‚ÄúFree trial‚Äù does not exist,"This app straight-up tricked me. The screen looked like I was starting a 7-day free trial, but the second I confirmed, it charged me $79.99 for a full year‚Äîno warning, no clear notice. And no, I didn‚Äôt forget to cancel after a trial period. I was immediately charged within seconds and I canceled immediately and never used the app beyond that point. I followed that up with a refund request to Apple within 5 minutes of the incident. 

Apple denied my refund, even though I‚Äôve never abused refunds and they‚Äôve helped in way more minor situations. Now I‚Äôm stuck either eating an $80 loss for an app I‚Äôve never used nor got the chance to even enjoy. This is making me rethink using Apple at all. If this is the kind of shady app they allow (and protect), that‚Äôs a huge red flag."

The features are awesome, but a lot of us don‚Äôt have 80+ bucks to spend on an editing tool.  I realize you have to keep up with the trend to stay afloat.  I bet you‚Äôd get even more clients offering $19.99 annually (special offer).
You‚Äôre on my of the best list for photo editing tools.  Between you and Photoleap by light tricks.  I‚Äôm old school,  can clean & sharpen photos the old way.  However, the instant gratification offered is hard to deny!"

2025-04-28 07:28:07-07:00,3,X10002,Was good until recent,"I used to love this app for the Ai replace feature, the editing tool was really helpful for getting rid of very specific blemishes in photos. I know there's other tools available but they didn't work nearly as well as the Ai replace. However, as of the past month or so it seems they've become a lot more ""strict"" on what is ""appropriate"" and not. It could be a pic of my face and the prompt could be ""remove this wrinkle"" and it'll say it was suggestive content and won't do it. Quite saddened by this abruptly change. I pay the $20 a month for it but as of late, doesn't seem worth it anymore. Other than that it's an okay app."
2025-04-26 10:32:45-07:00,1,Dottie1215,I thought this was a free app,You can‚Äôt do anything unless you pay for a subscription. Is anything free anymore?

Support Staff Won't Write Back,"I ended up paying for the premium subscription, because a lot of the features were really great. However, upon using the service and paying for it, there are numerous things that are limited. One of the specific settings is ""AI Replace"", which is amazing for editing trees to be a different type, cars to be an older model, or anything you are wanting to change to make the theme of your photo completely different. I found out that you can only use this feature 100 times per day, and if you are editing large volumes of picture as I am, you end up having to wait till the next day, which is a complete pain. I paid for the premium subscription so that it would be an unlimited use. Then as of two weeks ago, the company legitimately cut that in half and now you are only able to use this feature 50 times per day. That day I wrote a message to the support team and have received zero feedback. If I do not receive a message within the next two weeks, I will be canceling my subscription. It is completely unacceptable to pay for a service like this and not have unlimited use of all features in the app."

2024-05-05 20:37:26-07:00,2,Uneeklibeautiful,Recent Al Feature Updates Permanently Ruining App Performance,"I‚Äôve been a dedicated user of all the YouCam apps for years now. I pay annually and screentime suggests I spend about 30% of my time using them on average every week. When they first integrated the new Al feature into the Pro Removal feature I was impressed to see how it worked for the first time using the Perfect app. Then they added the Al Replace feature and I was over the moon; I even downloaded it for my two youngest daughters so they could experiment with it as well, and they loved it so I purchased the annual subscription for both of their iPads. Up to this point I had always considered these apps to be five star, two thumbs up, ten of ten , 100% satisfaction and all the positive feedback possible. 
Then the last few updates took place in the past couple weeks and I have had nothing but problems with the entire app, although primarily the problems have lied within the Al features. Every time I use the Removal feature, regardless if it‚Äôs set to plus or pro, it just gives me the ‚Äúplus‚Äù outcome of a messy product. Not a big deal tho since the Al Replace feature was still working fine and it could literally produce the same results as the Removal feature. Then the latest update was the last straw for me, because not only is the app now prompting me to ‚ÄúUPGRADE‚Äù after using it the allotted number of times per day, and not only is that impossible since I already have the highest purchase available, but now to top it all off, it won‚Äôt work at all, and every time I make an attempt, it presents an error message saying that the results are inappropriate and it doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm trying to make a dog into a cat or make grass a bit shorter; it‚Äôs all apparently inappropriate! So I‚Äôm fed up and I‚Äôd like to either get refunded at least for the purchases I made for my daughters who‚Äôve only had the app for a week now or if there‚Äôs any suggestions on how I can go about troubleshooting this issue on my own; I just want the old app and things back to normal here."

Those are unique to me and make me me. I didn‚Äôt want them removed. And I‚Äôd like the option to add them back without having to download and pay for another app. Can you help?  Not freckles. Moles.

2024-03-02 11:34:29-07:00,1,Ineedmessengerinapp,Deceptive scam,It‚Äôs highly unethical and intentionally deceptive to list a paid app in the store as free only to be asked for payment after downloading. It isn‚Äôt clear what you‚Äôre downloading based on the bio and I‚Äôm not sure how this is anything but a scam. I have to make an account and sign up for a free trial just to use any of the features? This is not a free app and should not be listed as such. I can only assume it‚Äôs set up this way so that they can collect and sell your data while charging YOU to do so.

2023-11-08 07:01:05-07:00,1,LaulalaO,Deeply Disappointed by Racial Bias in Ai YouCam,"Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

I recently downloaded the Ai YouCam photo editing app, hoping to enhance my photos and have some fun with the various filters and effects. However, I was deeply disappointed and offended by the racial bias that seems to be ingrained in the app's AI.

Every time I used the app, it would alter my appearance to resemble either an Asian or a white person. It consistently added straight hair to my photos, completely disregarding my natural curls. Moreover, the app consistently lightened my skin tone, which I found extremely offensive.

It appears that the AI in this app is programmed to adhere to white-centric and Asian beauty standards, completely ignoring the beauty and diversity of other races and ethnicities. This is not only disappointing but also deeply problematic, as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and biases.

The developers of this app need to address this issue immediately. It's 2023. 

The app also seems to have a limited understanding of diverse facial features. It consistently altered my selfie to fit a more Eurocentric or Asian standard. This is not only offensive but also a gross misrepresentation of global beauty standards. My ‚Äúselfie‚Äù did not look remotely close to me. 

Moreover, the app lacks options for different hair textures. It always defaults to straight hair, completely ignoring the beauty of curly, coily, or wavy hair types that are prevalent in various ethnic groups. This is a clear indication of the app's bias towards certain beauty standards, which is highly problematic.

The skin lightening feature is another glaring issue. It seems to promote the harmful notion that lighter skin is more desirable, which is a deeply rooted issue in many societies. This feature perpetuates colorism, a form of discrimination based on skin color, which is already a significant problem worldwide.

In conclusion, the Ai YouCam photo editing app is not inclusive and does not cater to the diverse beauty standards that exist globally. It is essential for the developers to address these issues and ensure that their app is representative of all users, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Until then, I cannot recommend this app to anyone who values diversity and inclusivity."

I liked the fact that you could make posters out of photos. But overall this app is a rip of and a scam. Instead of wasting your time on this app, I recommend TouchRetouch. Unlike this app it is a one time purchase for only $4.00 so its worth it."

2023-04-05 10:59:50-07:00,1,jaimemarita,Glitchy and confusing,"They have an online article about how to use their app to change out the color of specific objects within a photo. I downloaded the app to use it for this purpose and it appears that feature doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Also, it‚Äôs glitchy. When using the duplicate feature to duplicate an object, it allows you to position that duplicate where you want it before locking it in place. Every time I tried to do this, it moved the object down a few mm when I clicked the check mark to complete. After that point you can‚Äôt reposition."
2023-04-05 08:32:45-07:00,5,Blacklights&Glitter,Awesome.,"Love it. Works better than anything else for cutting out objects , the ai cutout option blows everyone else‚Äôs similar options out of the water and then mops the floor with them."

2023-03-21 22:25:16-07:00,4,CupcakeMartha,Great freebies,Great editing tools that are for feee if you don‚Äôt want to pay. BUT the app isn‚Äôt the most user friendly.

I tried to use the cartoon filter and then I tried to screen shot the photo and it blocked me from screenshoting the photo and even on the photo it has something else so I can‚Äôt see the photo.And this gets me so mad I have to delete the app. That was just one reason, my next reason is I have to pay for EVERYTHING a even backgrounds.The only thing I am asking for is limit the things that you put prices on to 10 things on that app the most please."

2023-03-03 06:33:59-07:00,1,AngelaAngelaAngelaNC,Not free they lie,"This app is not free. It says nothing about pricing until you sign up and give all of your information. This is dishonest business practice. I will report to the Better Business Bureau.

This is false advertising when something requires a credit card they are going to charge you. They say it‚Äôs free, but it‚Äôs not free because eventually there will be a charger in your account. Watch yourself."

Does wonders BUT what I didn‚Äôt like is that they took the fee when I signed up for a free trial and won‚Äôt get it back until after the 7 days even though I cancelled right away.

2023-02-02 23:52:59-07:00,1,LML19,Frustrating and time consuming,First time I paid for an editing app. With all the stars I was so hopefully. This app not only has it always frozen but it takes forever to detect faces and 99% of the time I have to scan it multiple times. In theory it‚Äôs awesome but I won‚Äôt renew. The freezing is frustrating and it‚Äôs just overpriced and not worth it.

And slowly I‚Äôve been losing features that I did have. Every time I update, it seems like a feature I‚Äôve used a million times, now isn‚Äôt available unless I pay. I‚Äôve been a long time user of this app. But why bother?"
